## General Information
- Build the model to find the demands of bike sharing and identify the factors influencing the user to use bike sharing platform
- Business problem is management wants to understand and decide the business strategy to meet the demand levels & customer's expectations. To understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- day.csv dataset is used to analyse this scenario.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
We derived few factors influencing the user to use bike sharing platform and the variables which affects the demand.

- Temperature and the seasons are like winter, summer and when there is working day, week days, users has high interested to use bike sharing. It is directly proportional, these variable can be considered to attract more users for future demand.

- During holiday or when there is high windspeed or suppose the season is mist, light snow, users are not having interested to utilise bike sharing platform. It is inverse proportion, some strategy can be formed to improve during the scenarios.Conclusion 1 from the analysis
