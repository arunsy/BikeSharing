## General Information
- Business problem is management wants to understand the affecting variables. Then forms the business strategy to meet the demand level & customer  expectation. To understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
- day.csv dataset has used to analyse this scenario.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
We derived few factors influencing the user to utilise bike sharing platform and the variables which affects the demand.

- Temperature, the seasons (winter, summer), when it's working day & week days has influenced users to use bike sharing significant. It is direct proportional and these variable can considered to attract more users for future demand.

- During holiday or when there is high windspeed or suppose the season is mist or light snow, users are not interested to utilise bike sharing. It is inverse proportional & form the effective strategy to improve during the scenario.
